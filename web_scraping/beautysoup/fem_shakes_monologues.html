O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.

O you leaden messengers,<br>\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<br>\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,<br>\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;<br>\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause<br>\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere<br>\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d<br>\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere<br>\nThat all the miseries which nature owes<br>\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,<br>\nAs oft it loses all, I will be gone;<br>\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.<br>\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although<br>\nThe air of paradise did fan the house<br>\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,<br>\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight<br>\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;<br>\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I\u2019ll steal away.\n</div>', u'<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Antony &amp; Cleopatra (Act 4 Scene 15)</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none"><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No more but e\u2019en a woman, and commanded<br>\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>\nAnd does the meanest chares.
